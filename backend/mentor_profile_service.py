3. Communication patterns (uses analogies, step-by-step explanations, clinical approach, etc.)
4. Key characteristics that make this doctor's approach unique
5. Common phrases or expressions they use (especially if in Portuguese)

Content to analyze:
---
{analysis_text}
---

Based on this analysis, create a detailed personality profile that will be used to make an AI assistant respond EXACTLY like Dr. {mentor_name}.

IMPORTANT: The AI assistant will ALWAYS respond in Portuguese (Brazil), so:
- If you find Portuguese expressions in the content, highlight them
- Analyze how the doctor communicates in Portuguese
- The final AI will use Brazilian Portuguese exclusively

Format your response as a structured profile with the following sections:
- WRITING_STYLE: (description)
- TONE: (description)
- COMMUNICATION_APPROACH: (description)
- UNIQUE_CHARACTERISTICS: (description)
- SAMPLE_PHRASES: (list of characteristic phrases, preferably in Portuguese if found)
